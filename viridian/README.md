# Viridian

Viridian is a common name for any Seaside VPN client.
There are several viridians available for different platforms and purposes.

## Viridian to whirlpool connection

Viridian connects to a `Whirlpool` server using one of the Seaside [protocols](./algae/typhoon/README.md).
It does not implement any common VPN specifications and no other API calls (REST, gRPC or anything else) are required.
This is done intentionally, so that even in the most restricted environments the most basic VPN functionality would be preserved.

## Viridian to surface connection
